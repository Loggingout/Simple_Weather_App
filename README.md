# Simple_Weather_App
This is my first project that I've uploaded to GitHub. It's minor but I'm proud of it. Going to be adding to it in the future.
I will be using a weather API-KEY from https://openweathermap.org/api
It's FREE
View their site, & find out what catches your interest.
Next I will be using the requests lib
Right along with the Json lib(converting the data from binary to text)
